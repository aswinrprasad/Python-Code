Python codes I learn day by day will be uploaded here.

## PROJECT PyCal

+ Python Calculator with CLI
+ Coded from scratch
+ Just me messing around with python

This is something I'm doing to just play around with python and the goal here is to make it as close as it can get to a basic calculator.
+ Input is given as of a normal calculator (eg :4Sin(60) or 6/3). So it is accepted as a string.
+ Basic operations plus additional functionalities.
